# Music-Player
A clean and simple music player made using HTML, CSS, JS.

Credits to [Lost Bong Coder](https://youtu.be/DYd5Mfah1Mg?feature=shared) for featuring a basic tutorial about Javascript player.


**How Does It Work ?**

All the audio files are stored in a folder and their names are stored seperately in a list.

All the audio files' link are stored in a list, along with their track images(in seperate list) in Javascript file from which it renders them and splits the name from it's extension to get the name for music.

More audios can be added through file upload ( I will keep on updating it, whenever I get time ). 

*Things to keep in mind* -
Give a name & poster link (you can upload in assets and link it) for every subsequent audio file else the image will not render anything.
